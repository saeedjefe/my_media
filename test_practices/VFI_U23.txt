The bar chart provides information on four weight categories reported in five age groups, ranging from 20 to 69
in a city called Newtown in the year 2010.

more 80 percent of people over 60 being either overweight or obese.

stood at only 15 percent. In contrast, more than half of 30-to-39-year-olds had an ideal weight, whereas this figure 
for inhabitants between 40 and 59 years old was almost 40 percent. 

In contrast, while more than half of the population between 50 and 60 were obese, this ratio among the
younger age groups was significantly lower, with less 5 %, almost 10 percent, and less than 25 percent of people
in 20-29, 30-39, and 40-49 age brackets, respectively, falling into this category.
