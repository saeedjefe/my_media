Life is unbelieveable, with some moments seeming appealing while others harsh. However, sometimes bad moments 
continue for a long time, becoming permenant. These permenant bad moments can be called bad siutations stemming 
from negatives factors, such as lack of money  or job dissatisfaction. While the assertion that surrondaring 
to these types of difficuties is the best way, there is another belief advocating for unwillingness to give up 
and the acceptance of the status co. In my opinion, if there is only a minscule chance of victory at the end, we 
should never give up, ever.
