With recycling  being absolutely crucial for sustainable development, some people contend that households' contributions as an input for the growth of this systemic approach is not enough. While Public obedience is the result of culture values, social norms, moral codes, and legal requirements, these people believe that the latter isthe only solution.

The conformity to impersonal rules typically relies on various measures, with the responses of various demographics varying significantly. However, the overwhelming majority of people will not abide by certain rules unless these rules become a legal requirement. For example, in my country, the reluctance  to fasten seat belts had led to law
enforcement addressing this issue through levying hefty fines. Since then, most of the people, used to avoid the hassle of fastening their seat belts, have become obedient, with this safety action becoming a social norm. Similarly, the same measure could be taken for the expansion of the recycling system. In other words, fines or charges could be
imposed on the citizens whose ignorance could simply lead to the fragility of this system. 

However, not always is the negative enforcement sufficient, with upper classes immune to monetary punishment. The encouragement of the households to contribute to the first phase of recycling system, the separation of recyclable raw materials such as glass, paper, and metal, through public praises and moral incentives, therefore, might seem to work, given that some individuals are more likely to be either socially or morally driven.The promotion of the notion that the separation of recyclable materials in the garbage collection process could be 
attributed to the conservation of the environment and sustainable economic development is a prime example. 

To conclude, in addition to legal enforcement, other pragmatic approaches, such as social and moral positive reinforcement, could be taken into account so that all the demographics are targeted.
