The transportation system relies on its infrastructure for the transfer of cargoes, livestock, and people. This 
system includes roadways, railways, airports, and, therefore, the distribution of government funds for the maintenance and renovation of these entities has been the subject of an ongoing debate, with some placing 
a particular emphasis on a greater budget allocation for railway system in comparison with roads. 

The main purpose of the transportation system is a safe distribution of industrial inputs and outputs which fulfills 
the basic needs of people living in a particular area. In fact, environmental changes might pose a threat to this
constant distribution taking place on roads. For example, torrential rains, heavy fogs, freezing temperature might  impede the movement of vehicles, with the safety of roadways jeopardized inevitably. As railways are 
more resilient to these environmental changes, the allocation of a greater proportion of funds to the expansion and
advancement of this mode of transportation as opposed to roadways may result in a more promising distribution, 
boosting economic growth and leading to a sustainable development. 

Apart from the economic and industrial benefits, the comparison of death tolls can also reflect the superiority of 
railway system. Sadly, road collisions contribute to the death of millions of people worldwide, while rarely do the railway accidents appear on the front-page headlines.

To conclude, so great are the advantages of more money allocation to railways that the implementation of this policy 
should be the priority of every country. Nevertheless, roadways are here to stay, with livelihood of the millions of people working in hauliers dependent on them.
