The plans illustrate the layout of a museum called Natural History in two separate years, 2003 and 2008.

Overall, the museum underwent significant changes, with the most noticable ones being the removal of 
the park, the relocation of the Mammals section, and the construction of a cafe, a shop, and a human origins 
display, all of which highlight a more visitor-friendly layout. 

In 2003, a garden was located to the left of the museum, while to the right stood an Ocean Hall. Ajacent to the
Ocean Hall lay a lobby, in which the only entrance was located. On the left side of the lobby was positioned a ticket desk. 

In 2008, however, the museum featured new facilities. The incorporation of a cafe, a shop, and a human 
origin centers lead to the demolition of the garden. Additionally, the relocation of the Mammals section to the area
behind the exhibit was another significant change. Additionally, a new zone called the Ice Age Exhibition was added
in the left-hand corner of the building, with a room named Insects positioned at its front left.
