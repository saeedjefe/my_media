Description types:

In the first step, we need a subject which describes what the statistical information is 
all about. 

Writing the simplest version of what the figure is all about might be a good idea. 

Chicken is consumed.

However, we shoud talk about how chicken is consumed, with the simple verbs to use 
being either 'to increase' or 'to decrease'.

Therefore, we should convert the simple version into a subject which could be followed a verb, in this case 
to increase or to decrease. 

Chicken is consumed. 
By converting 'is consumed' into a noun phrase, we may be able to use the entire clause, as a subject. 
is consumed
consumption

The use of 'the' before an abstract noun phrase is a common pattern. 
'the consumption'

Now, we should add the subject of the 'is consumed' to the 'consumption' by using a prepsition 'of',
which is again a common pattern. 

the consumption of chicken

So far, so good!! Now we have a abstract noun phrase with a subject in the form of a prepositonal phrase.
To avoid redundancy, we may eliminate the unnessary parts of our abstract noun phrase, with the leftover 
being only noun phrase.

Chicken conusmption

Now that we have engineered the cleanest version of the subject, we may apply the description 
types for describing a numerical value over a period of time. In this article, two types of
descriptions are suggestd: verb_based and noun_phrase_based

1-verb_based description

an action verb(intransitive) + an adverb of manner

Ex:
"to increase significantly"

Chicken consumption increased significantly.

But again, this is not the cleanest version to be used.
In other words, we can again convert this clause into an abstract
noun phrase.

Chicken consumption increased significantly -> 
a significant increase in chicken consumption

Now that the noun phrase has been engineerd, we may use a noun_phrase_based descrition.

2-noun_phrase_based description

There are four approaches for this type of description:
2-1 dummy_there
2-2 metaphorical_verbs
2-3 predicative adjective
2-4 passive form


2-1 dummy_there_description:
There is a significant increase in chicken consumption. 


2-2 metaphorical_verbs:
In this version, we may think of "chicken consumption" as a living organism who can 
can precieve statistical information, with verbs of perception comming into play.

to see
to observe

chicken consumption saw/observed a significant increase.

we may also use 'to experience'

Chicken cosumption experienced a significant increase. 


2-3passive_form:
a significant increase in chicken consumption was recorded
a significant increase was recorded in chicken consumption


2-4 predicative_adjective(not common):
the increase in chicken consumption was significant


However, verbalizing statistical information without adding the numrical values is 
worthless. 


Numerical extention:

1-point-to-point numerical extention
2-one-point-numerical extention
3-transitive-verb numerical extention
4-amount-based numerical extention


1-1 upward-or-downward-trend point_to_point numerical extention:
from 150 grams in 1979 to 200 grams in 1989

verb_based:
chicken consumption increased from 150 grams in 1979 to 200 grams in 1989.


noun_based:
an increase in consumption from 150 grams in 1979 to 200 grams in 1989

metaphorical_verbs:
chicken consumption experienced/saw a significant increase from 150 grams in 1979 to 200 grams in 1989.

dummy_there:
there is a significant increase in chicken consumption from 145 grams in 1979 to 200 grams in 1989. 

predicative adjective:
The increase in chicken consumption was significant from 145 grams in 1979 to 200 grams in 1989.

passive form:
a significant increase from 145 grams in 1979 to 200 grams in 1989 in chicken consumption was recorded
a significant increase from 145 grams in 1979 to 200 grams in 1989 was recorded in chicken consumption



1-2 volatile-trend point-to-point numerical extention:
from 170 grams to 230 grams over/during the first half of the period(in question) 
between 170 grams and 230 grams over/during the first half of the period(in question).

The verbs to be used in this particular type of description are "to range" and "to fluctuate". 

Chicken consumption ranged from almost  170 grams to 220 grams over the first half of the period.
Chicken consumption fluctuated between almost  170 grams and 220 grams over the first half of the period.


2- one_point_numerical extention:
at 220 grams in 1979
at 100 grams in 2004

at 240 grams for 5 years
at 50 grams over/during 20 years

a peak of 240 grams in 1984
at 240 grams for 5 years

an all-time high/low of 



2-1 stable-trend one-point numerical extention
fish consumption remained constant/unchanged at 50 grams over 20 years
fish consumption stabilized at 50 grams over 20 years
beef consumption plateaued/flattened out at 240 grams for 5 years


2-2 volatile-trend one-point numerical-extention
beef consumption peaked at 240 grams in 1984
beef consumption reached a peak of 240 grams in 1984
beef consumption reached an all-time high/low of 240 grams in 1984
beef consumption hit an all-time high/low of 240 grams in 1984


                
2-3 the-starting-and-end one-point numerical-extention:


verb-based description:
fish consumption started at 150 grams in 1979
fish consumption ended at 250 grams in 2004

noun-based description:
an initial fiugre of 60 grams
a final figure of 50 grams
*a decrease/increase of 70 grams led to/resulted in a final fiugure of 120 grams

3-transitive-verb numerical extention:

to reach x
to hit x
Chicken conumption reached a peak of 300 grams
Chikcen consumption hit an all time hime at 300 grams.



4-amount_based numerical extention:

point(2) - point(1) = amount
200 - 150 = 50 grams

(verb_based description) + by 50 grams
(noun_based description) of 50 grams

verb-based description:
Chicken consumption increased significantly by 50 grams
  
noun based description:
a significant increase of 50 grams in chicken consumption
