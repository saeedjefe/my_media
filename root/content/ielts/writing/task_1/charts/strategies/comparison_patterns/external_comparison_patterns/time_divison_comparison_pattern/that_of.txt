However, there can be still a minor improvment in our paragraph. With 'consumption' being used
redundantly, we had better find an alternative for it.

To tackle the problem, there are serveral ways. But Tehranina Polymath is going to use this case as
an excuse to explain a very important technique in modern English for the avoidance of redundancy.


'that':
Indeed, 'that ' is popular pronoun in English for refraining from repeating the same word. But to use 'that
' we should understand the formula.

Look at the candidates for which 'that' can be used as an alternative:

chicken consumption
lamb consumption
beef consumption
fish consumption

'that', interestingly, can be align with a proposition to tackle these issues, with the most common
type being 'that of'

But to do that, we have to make sure that 'that of' can be used instead of 'consumption' in these
phrases.

Therefore, let's tackle the problem linguistically:

'Consumption' is an abstract noun, with its root verb being consume. Therefore, we can convert it
into an abstract noun phrase. If you are not familiar with the concept of abstract noun phrseas, you
may need to read the article concerning nominalization.

fish Consumption -> an abstract noun
the consumption of fish -> an abstract noun phrase
Now, we can use 'that of' instead of 'the consumption of'
the consumption of fish -> that of fish

Let's update our paragraph by converting 'fish consumption'.

Overall, the trend in chicken consumption was upward, while lamb consumption exhibited a downward movement.
Conversely, there were fluctuations in beef consumption, whereas that of fish remained constant.

This is the overview of our task1 response. We have externally compared the overall trends.
