deductive body sentences:

metaphorical-verb version:
chicken consumption showed an (overall) upward trend.
chicken consumption started/stood(metaphoricall) at just below 145 grams in 1979.
chicken consumption reached approximately 245 grams in 1979.

dummy-there version:
there was an overall upward trend in chicken consumption
chicken consumption started/stood(metaphoricall) at just below 145 grams in 1979.
chicken consumption reached approximately 245 grams in 1979.


With chicken consumption repeated excessively, we need to cast aside this redundancy.
To get rid of 'chicken consumption', we can use an extermely important ligusitic concept called
reduction.

metaphorical-verb version reduction:
Chicken consumption showed an (overall) upward trend, standing at just below 145 grams in 1979 and
reaching approximately 245 grams in 2004.

dummy-there version reduction.
There was an (overall) upward trend in chicken cosumption, standing at just below 145 grams in 1979 and
reaching approximately 245 grams in 2004.


To tackle this puzzle, we should find the subject of the main clause in each version.

Chicken consumption showed an (overall) upward trend, standing at just below 145 grams in 1979 and
reaching approximately 245 grams in 2004.

'Chicken consumption' is clearly the main subject of main clause.


There was a (overall) upward trend in chicken consumption, standing at just below 145 grams in 1979 and
reaching approximately 245 grams in 2004.

with 'there' being a dummy subject, an (overall) upward trend is the main subject. Therefore, we should
figure what 'standing' and 'reaching' refer to, or else this is called 'a dangling modifier'. To
tackle the problem, we should reverse engineer the sentence.

There was an (overall) upward trend in chicken consumption which stood at just below 145 grams in 1979 and
reached approximately 245 grams in 2004.

 'which stood at just below 145 grams in 1979 and reached ...' is an adjective clause modifying the
noun preceding it. Hence, though not a dagnling modifier, this sentence may cause ambiguity.
In addition, experienced/saw are two metphorically actions verbs, whereas 'was' is simply a linking
verb describing neither an action nor an emotion with a dummy subject, 'there'.
