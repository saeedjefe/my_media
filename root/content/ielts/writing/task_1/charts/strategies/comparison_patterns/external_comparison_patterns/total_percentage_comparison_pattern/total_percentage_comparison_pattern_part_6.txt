total Percentage Comparison Pattern:

In order to tackle the process of describing pie charts smartly, you should find the patterns being
repeated in the sentences describing statistical information represented by this medium.
Tehranian Polymath has identified the algorithms whose sequences create the pattern, labelling them
as "Total Percentage Comparison Pattern".


There are four algorithms which are frequently used in this type of pattern. 

First: percent based description
the formula:
the percent + of + the whole + the (adverbial)* bridge + the item
*the advebial bridge is not always present in statistical reports

Second: percentage based description
the formula:
the percentage + of + the whole + the adjectival bridge + the item + linking verbs + percent

Third: item based description
the formula:
the item + ARM verbs + percent + of + the whole

Going through IELTS samples, you will learn these algorithms with which you can boost your morale. 

Percent Based Description

Book 10, Test 1


step 1: 
*extract the main topic and call it 'the whole'
the whole = 'Australina household energy use'

step 2:
reverse-engineer 'the whole' if needed
'Australian household energy use' is a quiet complicated noun phrase. So let's make it simple using
'reverse-egineering' 
reverse-engineering: 
2-1: the conversion of a noun phrase into an abstract noun phrase:
To do that, you should find the most right-sided noun and find out whether its origin is a verb.
With the right most noun being 'use', we are pretty sure that the root is a verb. 

The next step is to bring it to the beginning of the phrase and add a specific determiner  to it , in this
case 'the'

the use fo Australian house enegy

step 3:

Needing a clause(subject + verb) to answer this task one question, we should convert this abstract
noun phrase into a clause. To do that, we should a have subject. Let's find out whether we can extract a
subject from this abstract noun phrase.
 
the use of Australian household energy

'of Australian household enery' could be both the subject in 'of phrase form' and the object in 'of phrase
form. Eihter away, we should get rid of 'the' and use 'use' as a verb 
Let's try both of them:

subject: Australian household energy is used(passive)
object: to use Australian household enery(a verb phrase with no subjects)

It is a good idea to stick with the subject option so that we don't make the process harder by
adding a new word(subject) to this. Therefore, let's assign it to 'the whole' varible. 
the whole = Australian household energy is used

step 4:
Now, let's find the second variable, 'the item', in our algorithm. Looking at the pie chart, you may choose
heating, cooling, lighting, water heating, refrigeration, or other appliances.
Let's choose 'heating', assing it to a variable called 'item'. 
item = heating

step 5:
dis
In this stage, we should build the 'adverbial bridge'
Look at the question:'The first chart below shows how energy is used'. 'how' is a clear sign of the
averbial function 'means or methods', purpose. Looking at the table created by Tehranian Polymath, we can
choose between the following prepositions: by/via/through/with/by dint of/by means of
In our case, 'by' seems to be the best and simplest option. Let's pick this one over others.
bridge = by
the whole + the bridge + the item
Australian household energy is used + for(purpose) + heating
step 6:
In the final stage, we should fit the last piece of puzzle by looking at the proportion of heating
which is 42%.
the percent+ of + the whole(clause) + the bridge + the item
42% + of Australian household energy is used + for + heating.
Now, let's write our sentence:
42% of Australian household energy is used by heating. 

done

Percentage Based Description:

step 1:

We have already figured some variables to use for this formula:
the whole(noun phrase) + the adjectival bridge + the item 
Australian household energy +  which is used by + heating

'which is used' is an ajective clause with a 'to be' verb, 'is'. Therefore, it can be reduced.

the whole(noun phrase) + the reduced adjectival bridge + the item
Australian household energy + used by + heating

step 3:
adding the subject and the verb to create a clause
the percentage + of + the whole + the adjectival bridge + the item + linking verbs + percent
the percentage + of + Australian household energy + used by heating + stands at/is + 42%.


Item Based Description:
Although the list of verbs used in this algorithm may be longer, the 'ARM' verbs, addressing the
most generic contexts,  are probably the safest option, with the acronym 'ARM' standing for 'account for',
'represent', 'make up'. 
the item + (ARM) verbs + percent + of + the whole
heating accounts for 42% of (Australian household) energy use.
heating represents 42% of (Australian household) energy use.
heating makes up 42% of (Australian household) energy use.

Reasoning Tree Leverage:
We are pretty sure that you have heard the term 'Synonyms'. However, we use a different approach for
that in which synonyms could be further classified into either superordiantes, subordinates, or
coordinates.To make this classification more understanble, Tehranan Polymath has create a digagram
'the resoning tree' inwhich the top most item is the most generic term, with the items down the tree being more
specific. In addition, the items which are next eacher in the tree are called coordinates.   
                
			                                  energy use                 
energy consumption(amount used, quantified) 	     energy utilization(purposeful use of energy)

As you can see, 'energy use' is a superordinate to its subordiantes(energy consumption and energy
utilization), with the subordinates being cooridinates to one another. 

With utilization being a purposeful use of energy, the closest match could be consumption. Therefore, we can apply it to the same algorithms.
  
Percent Based Description(leveraging resoning tree):
Australian household energy consumption
the consumption of Australian household energy
Australian household energy is consumed by heating
42% of Australian household energy is consumed by heating

Percentage Based Description(leveraging reasoning tree):
The percentage of Australian household energy consumed by heating stands at/is 42%.

Item Based Description(leveraging reasoning tree):

Heating consumes 42% of Australian household energy.

Finally, you may use the most generic way for describing statistical data to address the information
in a pie chart, as well.  

Figure Based Description:

The figure for + item + linking verbs + the percent

The figure for Heating is/stands at 42%.

Now, let's focus on the second pie chart in the question. 

Remember, there are three alogrithms to be used, starting with the first one:

percent based description
step 1: 
extract the main topic, modified and call it 'the whole'

Australian household green house emission

can we say that emission has a verb root???
Despite the fact that emission has a verb form, 'emit', we are not  100% sure that this emission
refers to that act of emitting. This is because 'emission' itself can express an entity, a matter.
Therefore, we can't be 100% sure that the previous formula works here, as well. For the sake of
curiosity, however, let's reverse engineer 'Australian household greenhouse gas emissions'.

Australian household greenhouse gas emissions 
the emission of Australina household greenhouse gas
Australian household greenhouse gas is emitted
the whole = 'Australian greenhouse gas is emitted'
the whole + adverbial bridge + the item
Australian household greenhouse gas is emitted + adverbial function + heating

let's look at the question to find out what adverbial function is being expressed in the question. 
'The second chart shows the greenhouse gas emissions which result from this energy use.'
The type of adverbial function is clearly 'cause and result'.
Here is a snippet of the Tehranian Polymath table classifying adevbial functions. To see the entire
tabel, click on the adverbial function table. 
Ok, let's find out whether we can build an adverbial bridge between 'the whole' and 'the item'.
Australian household greenhouse gas is emitted + ??? + heating.

It seems that the clause version doesn't work. Therefore, let's stick to the noun phrase version of
the whole. --> 'Ausralian household greenhouse gas emissions'
Then, apply that to the formula:
the whole + the adverbial bridge + the item
Australian household greenhouse gas emssions result from/are attributed to/stem from/arise from
heating.
'result form' and 'are attributed' are perhaps stronger alternatives.

the percent + of + the whole + the adverbial bridge + the item
42% of gas emissions result from/are attributed to heating.

Percentage Based Description:

the percentage + of + the whole + the adjectival bridge + the item + percent


The precentage of gas emissions which result from heating is/stands at 42%.
The precentage of gas emissions which are attributed to heating is/stands at 42%.
The precentage of gas emissions which stem from heating is/stands at 42%.
The precentage of gas emissions which arise from heating is/stands at 42%.

Reduction:

The precentage of gas emissions resulting from heating is/stands at 42%.
The precentage of gas emissions  attributed to heating is/stands at 42%.
The precentage of gas emissions  stemming from heating is/stands at 42%.
The precentage of gas emissions  arising from heating is/stands at 42%.



Item Based Description:

the formual:

the item + ARM verbs + of + the total

Heating accounts for 42% of total gas emssions.
Heating represents 42% of total gas emssions.
Heating makes up 42% of total gas emssions.


To seem more professional, we may use the verbs expressing cause and result in the item based
description.

Heating leads to 42% of
 total gas emssions.
Heating causes 42% of total gas emssions.
Heating results in 42% of total gas emissions. 

We are not done yet.
