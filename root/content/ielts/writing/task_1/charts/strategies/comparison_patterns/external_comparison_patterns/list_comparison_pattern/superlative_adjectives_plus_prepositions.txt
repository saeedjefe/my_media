Telegram is the most popular social media app in the world. 
But being too generic, this sentence lacks statistical information. Therefore, 
we need to add numbers to the previous sentence. 

how to add numbers to the text:

'with and at' numercial description:
prepositions(with, at) for adding numbers
paranthesis:


You may have seen 'with' as a preposition whereby numbers can be added to a
sentence where the most or the least is being described. 

Telegram is the most popular social media app, with 1 billion users worldwide. 

Nonetheless, the use of 'with' in statistical contexts, Tehranian Polymath believes,  needs
further linguisitics explanation. To tackle the problem, Tehranian Polymath has tried to
reverse-engineer the sentence so that his inference helps you have a firmer grasp of the concept.
 
Look at the reverse-engineered version:

Telegram is the most popular social media app.
Telegram has 1 billion users.

Now, to merge to sentence into one, we may use either an adverb or an adjective
clause. 

Let's start with the adjective clause:

Telegram, which has 1 billion users, is the most popular social media app.

There is a usage of with which expresses possession, making 'with' a perfect
candidate for the adjective clause with 'has or have' as a verb.

example:
a man who has a white beard -> a man with while beard
telegram which has 1 billion users -> telegram with 1 billion users
Telegram, with 1 billion users, is the most popular social media app. 

With adjective cluse preceding the reducntion being non-restricitve, 'with' can be used in three adverbial positions, initial, mid, and final. 

Initial:
with 1 billion users, Telegram is the most popular social media app.

mid:
Telegram, with 1 billion users, is the most popular social media app.

final:
Telegram is most popular social media app, with 1 billion users. 



The use of 'at':

Although less common in IELTS, 'at' is another candidate to add numerical
information to a sentence. 

Telegram is the most popular app, at 1 billion users.

But again the question is where this 'semantic extension' comes from.

Tehranian Polymath has tried to reverse-engineer the sentence for further clarification:

Telegram stands at 1 billion users.
Telegram is the most popular app.

To merge these to sentences into one sentence again, we may use either an
adjective or an adverb clause.

This time, I am going to use an adverb clause and, then, reduce it.

Because Telegram stands at 1 billino uses, telegram is the most popular app.

Since 'stand' here is a 'linking verb', expressing neither an action nor an emotion, we may replace it with 'to be' despite the fact that 'is' dosen't express the metaphorical sense of 'stand' which means
being steady not moving.

Because telegram is at 1 billion users, it is the most popular app.

Now, let's reduce the adverb clause. 

Being at 1 billion users, Telegram is the most popular app. 

Now, let's get rid of 'being' since it is purely a linking verb, putting it in
three different averbial positions: initial, mid, final

starting with initial:

At 1 billion users, Telegram is the most popular app.

mid position:
Telegram, at 1 billion users, is the most popular app.

final position:
Telegram is the most popular app, at 1 billion users.
