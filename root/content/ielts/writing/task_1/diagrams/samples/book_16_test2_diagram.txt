The given diagram illustrates the stages of a process whereby sugar is produced from sugar cane.

There are seven steps in the procedure, starting with cultivation and ending with production.  

Initially, after growing for 12-18 months, sugar crane is harvested. Workers carry out the harvesting process either manually, 
using machetes, or mechanically, using sophisticated machinery. This is followed by the crushing step in which juice is extracted from the 
sugar cane. Following the extraction is the purification taking place inside a limestone filter. The conversion of the juice
into syrup inside an evaporator ensues, before the separation of sugar crystals from the syrup by means of a centrifuge. Finally, with the sugar 
crystals having been dried and cooled, sugar is ready to be packaged and distributed.
