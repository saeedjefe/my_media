The diagram illustrates the process whereby plastic bottles are recycled for the production of goods.

Overall, there are nine stages in the procedure, starting with the gathering and transportation of discarded plastic bottles followed by processing
them and ending with the production of goods to be used again. 

Initially, discarded plastic bottles are gathered into bins, designated for recycling. The gathered plastic bottles are then transported via 
lorries to recycling centers, where they are sorted out. The sorted bottles are then compressed into blocks before being crushed by two gaint 
sprocket wheels. After being crushed, they are washed before being used for the production of plastic pellets. The heating of pellets for the 
formation of raw material is the next step, resulting in the packaging of the raw material which is finally used so as to produce recycled 
goods, including shirts, bags, pens, and, of course, bottles.
