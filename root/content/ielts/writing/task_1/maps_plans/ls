The floor plans depict the layout of the Natural History Museum in 2010 and 2013, highlighting how the internal structure evolved over this three-year period.

Overall, several new facilities were introduced, including a café, a shop, and a human origins display, reflecting a shift toward a more visitor-oriented layout.

By 2013, the garden had been replaced by new functional spaces including a café, a gift shop, and a Human Origins display.

Additionally, the Mammals section was relocated to the back of the newly added Human Origins area, indicating a shift in the sequence of exhibits.

The maps depict an industrial district in Norbiton town, with the top diagram
illustrating the current lauyout and the bottom showing the proposed development.

The zone is set to undergo massive changes:the introduction of a medical center,
shops, a playground, and a school to the area, the replacement of factories by housing, the
building of new roads leading into the farmaland, and the
installation of a new roundabout at the  south end of the area.

The area is heavily industrilized at the moment, with one roundabout in the
center, numerous factories lining the east road and the roundabout itself, a
high way in the south, and isolated farmland in the north with no means of transportation. 

However, the factories are proposed to be replaced with housing, with the
incoporation of shops and a medical center to the south-west and south-east  of
the central roundabout, respectively. Additionally, the construction of a school
at the end of the east road and a play ground to the south of the river
are two other plans decided for the Norbiton industrial area, while the north of
the city will also experience some significant modifications. Indeed, to the
north of the roundabout will stand a dead-end road which will lead into
farmland after having crossed the north river. Additionally, to the nort-west of the central square, a
short road will be erected.

When giving absolute directions on a map, you typically use cardinal directions (north, south, east, west) and their combinations (north-east, south-west, etc.) to refer to fixed points or regions. Here are some common prepositional phrases and sentence structures that help give absolute directions:

### 1. Using "In the" for General Absolute Locations
   - "In the north of the city": Refers to a location within the northern part of the city.

     - Example: "The port is in the south-east of the country."

### 2. Using "On the" for Boundaries or Sides
   - "On the east side of the city": Refers to a location on the eastern boundary or side of the city.
     - Example: "The train station is on the east side of the city."
   - "On the west coast of the country": Refers to a location along the western coastline.
     - Example: "The city is on the west coast of the country."

### 3. Using "At the" for Specific Points
   - "At the northern tip of the island": Refers to a specific point at the very north of the area.
     - Example: "The lighthouse is located at the northern tip of the island."
   - "At the south-western corner of the city": Refers to a precise corner or point.
     - Example: "The stadium is at the south-western corner of the city."

### 4. Using "To the" for Nearby Locations
   - "To the north of the city": Refers to an area outside or adjacent to the northern boundary.
     - Example: "The forest is to the north of the city."
   - "To the east of the river": Refers to something nearby in the eastward direction from a landmark.
     - Example: "The airport is to the east of the river."

### 5. Using "Towards" for Directional Movement
   - "Towards the south of the city": Implies a movement or area in the southern direction.
     - Example: "The road leads towards the south of the city."

### 6. Combining Cardinal Directions
   - "In the north-western part of the region": Combines cardinal directions for a more specific absolute location.
     - Example: "The mountain range is in the north-western part of the region."
   - "At the south-eastern corner of the island": Refers to a specific corner, using combined directions.
     - Example: "The harbor is located at the south-eastern corner of the island."

The given plans depict Souhtwest airport, with the first diagram illustrating the
current site and the second showing the proposed redevelopment.

The total area of the airport is set to increase so that it can feature new
services such as sky train system, a hire car  service and a bag drop.

Located at the front left of the airport is a departure lounge, with an exit at the
front, a check-in area near the back left-hand corner and a cafe in the back
right-hand corner. Adjacent to the departure lounge lies an arrival lounge 
on whose front side is also an entrance. Behind the arrival and departure
lounges are Passport Control Customs and Security Passport Control areas,
respectively. Behind these areas are two trapiziod-shaped hallways reaching into a
rectangular area inside which lie two walk ways inlined with 8 gates.

The airport is set to undergo significant changes: the addition of an exit and entrance to
the lounges, a remarkable increase in the number of gates from 8 to 17 leading
to a Y-shape extension at the rear of the aiport, and the introduction of some
customer-friendly services. Indeed, an ATM is planned to be installed on the
right side of departure lounge, with a cafe behind it and a car hire service in front, 
respectively, while a bag drop in the rear left-hand corner of the departure lounge will be 
introduced.

Divergence:

 1. “The road diverges into two smaller lanes, one heading northwest and the other northeast.”
 2. “From the central roundabout, the main road splits, stretching toward the east and southeast.”
 3. “At the southern edge of the town, the highway branches off into multiple roads leading to the west and southwest.”

Convergence:

 1. “Two major highways converge at the roundabout in the northern part of the city.”
 2. “Roads from the northeast and northwest merge into a single route leading south.”
 3. “In the southern district, several smaller streets join together to form the main road heading eastward.”
