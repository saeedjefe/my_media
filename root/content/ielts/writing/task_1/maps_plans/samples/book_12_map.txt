The maps compare Islip's town center with the top one depicting its current layout and the bottom illustrating its proposed development.

Overall, the center of Islip city is set to undergo massive changes, with the construction of a dual carriageway and the introduction of new housing, a shopping center, a car park, and a bus station.


At the north end of the area lies the countryside, to the south of which stands a main road, sandwiched between shops, one to its north and
another to its south. Housing, on the other hand, is positioned in the center as well as in the south. Situated in the southwest is a school,
while a park occupies the eastern part. The main road, also, branches off into two minor roads, with the eastern one meandering south and ends
at the school and the western road stretching towrads the park.  

The planned demolition of northern countryside, main road, and shops, paired with the erection of a dual carriageway, will lead to a complete
transformation of the city's current layout. Running from the east to the west, the dual carriageway will encircle the area where all the
building and facilities of the city center will be introduced, with the southern housing and school planned to be outside the crilce. In the 
northeast of the area encircled by the dual  carriageway will be new housing with a minor road, to the west of which will be a car park whose west
side will be occupied by a shopping center, with a bus station adjacent to this. At the heart of the city center will be a space for pedestrians
only, whose south side will be shops. Lastly, the park, reduced in size, will stand in the same location, next to which another area in which
another new housing is planned, will be located.
