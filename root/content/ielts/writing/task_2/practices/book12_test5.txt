Since the dawn of human civilzation, the exchange of value has been a major concern for mankind, with the invention of money being , perhaps,
one of the means to avoid conflicts stemming from the uncertainties about the proportionality or fairness of the assets
being traded. In post-industrial societies, however, the most important asset is arguably information, with economies being heavily dependent
on it. Therefore, some people are of the opinion that in some professional domains, such as scentific research, business, and academic world, 
where the outcomes are manily beneficial to the public, the availability of information should be limitless. However, there is a strongly-held
belief that the exchange of value--in this case, information--should be fair, with the value and importance of data determining the access terms.

Let's start with knowledge systems. Indeed, because academic fields, disciplines, institutions, roles, and activities heavily rely on data, open
and unlimited access to information may foster scientific growth. For example, the purchase of journals, books, and dissertations in different
fields, such as medicine, the humanities, and engineering, may not be possible for certain institutions. Consequently, academia may not be able to
keep up with the rapid pace of developments simultaneously happening in other parts of the world.
In addition to the academic world, the application of quantitative studies, namely statistical modeling, might not be feasible unless large
amounts of information are readily accessible to the scientific community, and, not surprisingly, financial barriers could hinder their
implementations. The elimination of this barrier, therefore, would greatly benefit the application of such studies.
Aside from knowledge systems, the flowering of a country's economy could be the direct result of the expansion of its business sectors, either
private or public, with open access to data triggering the process of innovation and, consequently, revenue generation.   
A prime example can be found in  the software ecosystem, where Linux--the main operating system from which other operating systems are derived-
-is open source, with developers around the world contributing their painstaking efforts to its progress. This could lead to the exponential
growth of cutting-edge technologies shaping the  foundation of small and big businesses alike. 


However, the unrestricted sharing of knowledge may adversely impact the professional domains. As far as the business industry 
is concerned, what makes a product or an innovation valuable is its scarcity. With detailed information of the innovation openly accessible to 
the public, the final product could be reversed-engineered. Consequently, barring patent protection, rival companies 
may steal the result of intellectual endeavors, with the revenue, which could have been largely generated, being squandered. Conversely, 
if payment is required, then financial gains could be possible for the company or the inventor, possibly leading to greater commercial success.
The same is true for the academic world, where the budget of educational institutions largely comes from government funding and tuition fees. Although
free access to data may boost global scientific collaboration, a subscription fee for viewing the latest articles could be charged so that 
the availability of more money leads to more advanced research methods.  


In my opinion, neither the possibility of unlimited access to free resources in certain professional domains nor the monetization of important
information is sustainable. With regard to open access to unlimited data, it is important to recognize that nothing is truly free. In fact, no
one surmounts the difficulty of creating valuable data without the aim of meeting his financial needs. In other words, even if some
information is freely accessible, there will always be some finanicial incentives, as drawing public attention might be a marketing strategy, 
eventually benefiting the creators. On the other hand, the idea of monetizing important and valuable information 
may not be always viable since there could be a few significant concerns, such as security, which could be endangered 
if such information becomes accessibile to the purchasers. Therefore, both of these arguments have critical shortcomings.
