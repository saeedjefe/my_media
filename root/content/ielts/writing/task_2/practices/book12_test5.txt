Since the dawn of human civilzation, the exchange of value has been a major concern for mankind, with the invention of money being , perhaps,
one of the means to avoid conflicts stemming from the uncertainties about the proportionality or fairness of the assets
being traded. In post-industrial societies, however, the most important asset is arguably information, with economies being heavily dependent
on it. Therefore, some people are of the opinion that in some professional domains, such as scentific research, business, and academic world, 
where the outcomes are manily beneficial to the public, the availability of information should be limitless. However, there is a strongly-held
belief that the exchange of value--in this case, information--should be fair, with the value and importance of data determining the access terms.
