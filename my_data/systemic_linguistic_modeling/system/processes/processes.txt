chronological flow

1. Input Acquisition
2. Internal Transformation
3. Output Production
4. Distribution
5. Feedback Reception
6. Adaptation (loop or reaction)
7. Maintenance (always ongoing)
8. Growth and Development (gradually ongoing)
9. Emergence (unexpected, anytime)
10. Replication/Reproduction (when system is stable)
11. Death/Dissolution (if system collapses)


Top 5 processes (Input ➔ Feedback) = very chronological.

Middle processes (Adaptation, Maintenance, Growth, Emergence) = cyclical or ongoing.

End processes (Replication, Death) = chronological outcomes.


Phase	Processes
Chronological Core	Input ➔ Transformation ➔ Output ➔ Distribution ➔ Feedback
Cyclical Maintenance	Adaptation, Homeostasis, Growth
Unexpected Layer	Emergence
Life Cycle End	Replication, Death
