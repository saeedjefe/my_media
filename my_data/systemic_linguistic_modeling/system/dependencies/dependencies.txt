Dependency Type	Description	Example
Resource Dependency	One part needs material, energy, or information from another.	A city needs water supply systems.
Functional Dependency	One process or operation needs another to function first.	Education system depends on governance and funding.
Structural Dependency	One part physically or organizationally supports another.	Courts depend on legal frameworks and constitutions.
Temporal Dependency	One event must occur before another can happen.	Students must graduate before they can enter the workforce.
Causal Dependency	One action triggers or enables another action.	Mass protests cause political reforms.
Hierarchical Dependency	Lower layers rely on higher organizational control.	Municipal governments depend on national government policy.
Feedback Dependency	Adjustment processes rely on feedback signals.	Businesses rely on customer feedback to improve products.
Environmental Dependency	System survival depends on external environment conditions.	Agriculture depends on stable climate and soil quality.
